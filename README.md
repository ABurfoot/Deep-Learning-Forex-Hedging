Forex Hedging Recommendation System

Overview
This project is an advanced forex hedging recommendation system that leverages deep learning techniques to provide personalized hedging strategies. It employs an ensemble of neural network models, including LSTM, GRU, and CNN, to analyze historical forex data and user inputs for generating optimal hedging recommendations.
Features

Supports multiple currency pairs worldwide
Utilizes yfinance for real-time forex data retrieval
Implements Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning
Incorporates multiple technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, ATR)
Combines neural network predictions with rule-based recommendations
Provides detailed implementation steps for each recommended hedging strategy
Generates personalized recommendations based on user inputs and risk profile

Requirements

Python 3.7+
PyTorch
NumPy
Pandas
scikit-learn
SciPy
yfinance
scikit-optimize

Installation

Clone this repository: git clone [repository URL]
Install the required packages:
Copypip install torch numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy yfinance scikit-optimize


Usage
Run the main script:
Copypython main.py
You will be prompted to enter various details about your forex exposure and company profile, including:

Currency pair (e.g., USD/EUR)
Amount of exposure
Duration of exposure
Risk tolerance
Company size and resources
Hedging preferences and constraints

The program will then:

Retrieve historical forex data
Train and optimize the ensemble model
Generate hedging recommendations
Provide detailed implementation steps for top recommendations

How it Works

Data Retrieval: Uses yfinance to download historical forex data.
Data Preparation: Calculates technical indicators and prepares sequences for the neural network models.
Model Training: Employs an ensemble of LSTM, GRU, and CNN models, optimized using Bayesian optimization.
Recommendation Generation: Combines neural network predictions with rule-based recommendations.
Strategy Implementation: Provides detailed steps for implementing each recommended hedging strategy.

Key Components

load_and_preprocess_data(): Prepares and engineers features from raw forex data.
EnsembleModel: Combined LSTM, GRU, and CNN neural network model.
optimize_hyperparameters(): Uses Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
neural_network_recommendation(): Generates recommendations based on the trained model.
recommend_hedging_methods(): Provides rule-based recommendations.
get_hedging_template(): Generates detailed implementation steps for each strategy.

Limitations

Forex markets are inherently unpredictable and affected by many external factors. This tool should be used for educational and informational purposes only, not for actual trading decisions.
The accuracy of recommendations can vary significantly depending on market conditions and the quality of input data.
